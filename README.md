## ABSTRACT
_Am I the A-hole_ is an online community on the popular social news website [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com). Users post descriptions of personal experiences asking the community to assign one of the following labels to their scenario:
- You're the A-hole (YTA)
- You're Not the A-hole (NTA)
- Everyone Sucks Here (ESH)
- No A-holes here (NAH)
- Not Enough Info (INFO)

We will collect a large amount of posts from the [Am I the A-hole](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/) subreddit and analyze the dataset in order to predict what label will be assigned to a particular scenario. We will discuss the performance of our model and the methods we used to pre-process the data.
